## Timothy Robinson

I am an enthusiastic, hardworking individual with a passion for clear and clever programming and an undergraduate degree in Film and English Literature Studies from the University of East Anglia.

After discovering the world of programming to be stimulating both intellectually and creatively, I began teaching myself basic Javascript, CSS and HTML. Once I felt confident it was a career path I was eager to pursue, I decided that attending Makers Academy was the most logical and practical step forwards.

From graduation onwards, I'm seeking to begin an exciting career in web development in a collaborative and team-based environment and to continue learning and advancing my skills as a developer.

## Skills

#### Expression & Communication

Having a background education in English literature has helped me develop and refine my communication skills to a very high standard, allowing me to present myself clearly and and explain my thoughts in a precise and straightforward manner.

- Communication was exceptionally important in earning my literature degree as a large amount of team work and co-operation was involved in literary discussions and group assignments.
- Through studying film and editing footage I learned that written or verbal communication isn't the only way to express yourself clearly, and I believe that code can be just as expressive, descriptive and precise.

#### Teamwork

Having a positive and open-minded personality, I'm always willing to listen and offer my own input on any given team effort. As a co-operative and responsible individual, I can be relied upon as a valuable and optimistic member of any team.

- Whilst working and writing for the tech and gaming section of the University of East Anglia's newspaper, Concrete, I developed a keen set of skills for working with others as part of a larger team. I always ensured that everyone received help with their articles when it was needed, and that we collectively achieved our set deadlines.

#### Diligence & Time management

I'm a highly organised and punctual individual with a propensity for arriving early for most occasions. My diligence whilst proof-reading and pedantic eye for grammar and syntax errors in English text transfer very effectively to proof-reading and debugging sections of code.

- I embarked on a world trip in 2016 for a total duration of seven months. Whilst in transit I was required to keep all of my documentation in order and apply for various visas en route. My organisational skills and punctuality were integral in ensuring a smooth and unhindered trip.

#### Intelligence & Drive

My natural desire to learn and expand my knowledge base has led me to programming as a very desirable, knowledge-based field. I'm always extremely keen to continue learning and take on board new and interesting or useful information. The world of computer languages is an exceptionally good avenue for me to satisfy my desire to learn.

#### Adventurousness

I spent the majority of 2016 on a world trip to explore new places and seek new adventures. It was during this trip that I discovered my passion for programming and planned to pursue that as my next course of action after returning home. I'm always looking to try new things and involve myself in new experiences.

## Experience

**Oakfield Park** (2015 to 2017)

*Social Media and Video Producer*

My previous working experience has taken place in Donegal, Ireland. I've spent my time working at my family garden and parkland, Oakfield Park, and have invested my efforts into promoting it and helping to maintain Oakfield's consistent social media presence.

Putting my film and editing skills to work, I have worked hard to shoot, edit and produce various promotional videos. Many of these can be found on Oakfield Park's Facebook page.

**Envy Post Production** (2015)

*In-house runner and deliveries*

Prior to travelling in 2016, I spent two weeks completing a work internship at Envy Post Production House in London, working as a runner and delivering packages. I was required to be punctual, and was relied upon to provide any on-hand assistance in the editing suites that was necessary.

Additionally, I have internship experience working alongside television editors at Talkback Thames during 2010. Film & television editing was the career avenue I was actively pursuing prior to the discovery of my love of code.

## Interests

- I'm very interested in video editing and production, and attended an Oxford Royale Summer Film Studies Course in 2011.
- Adventuring to new places and exploring new cultures and ideas. I spent most of 2016 on a world trip, and went interrailing across Europe in 2014.
- Logic and mind puzzles, such as solving a difficult code kata, crosswords and completing sudokus.
