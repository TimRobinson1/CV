I am an enthusiastic, hardworking individual with a passion for clear and clever programming and an undergraduate degree in Film and English Literature Studies from the University of East Anglia.

After discovering the world of programming to be stimulating both intellectually and creatively, I began teaching myself basic Javascript, CSS and HTML. Once I felt confident it was a career path I was eager to pursue, I decided that attending Makers Academy was the most logical and practical step forwards.

After graduating from Makers' Academy, I'm looking to begin an exciting career in web development in a collaborative and team-based environment and to continue learning and advancing my skills as a developer.

## Skills

#### Expression & Communication

- Communication was exceptionally important in earning my literature degree as a large amount of team work and co-operation was involved in literary discussions and group assignments.
- Through studying film and editing footage I learned that written or verbal communication isn't the only way to express yourself clearly, and I believe that code can be just as expressive, descriptive and precise.

#### Teamwork

- Having a positive and open-minded personality, I'm always willing to listen and offer my own input on any given team effort. As a co-operative and responsible individual, I can be relied upon as a valuable and optimistic member of any team.
- Whilst working and writing for the tech and gaming section of the University of East Anglia's newspaper, Concrete, I developed a keen set of skills for working with others as part of a larger team. This developed further at Makers Academy as I worked with my team to co-ordinate our project using XP values, following practices such as stand ups and retros.

#### Diligence & Time management

- My diligence whilst proof-reading and pedantic eye for grammar and syntax errors in English text transfer very effectively to proof-reading and debugging sections of code.
- I embarked on a world trip in 2016 for a total duration of seven months. Whilst in transit I was required to keep all of my documentation in order and apply for various visas en route. My organisational skills were integral in ensuring a smooth and unhindered trip.

#### Adventurousness

I spent the majority of 2016 on a world trip to explore new places and seek new adventures. It was during this trip that I discovered my passion for programming and planned to pursue that as my next course of action after returning home. I'm always looking to try new things and involve myself in new experiences.

My previous working experience has taken place in Donegal, Ireland. I've spent my time working at my family garden and parkland, Oakfield Park, and have invested my efforts into promoting it and helping to maintain Oakfield's consistent social media presence.
